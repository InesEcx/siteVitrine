                    <p class="animate-text">I am a 22 years-old woman studying Information Technology at Burgundy University named
                        Inès. However, my friends call me Ness so feel free to do so too. I am curious by nature, I vively 
                        appreciate learning new things. I am also not scared of making thoughtful decisions and take responsability 
                        from them. I also speak fluent French and English. I was learning Italian and Chinese in school and I'm still 
                        learning on my own now. Fondly Ness. </p>

                    <h2 class="animate-text">How I put my free time in use</h2>
                    <p class="animate-text"> I enjoy simple stuff such as going out with friends 
                        or stay cosy at home. However, what I could do all day withtout any problem is drawing. I am what you could 
                        call a digital artist. Also, I am not really a gamer but I vively enjoy playing Genshin Impact whenever I can. 
                        I also am addicted to watching movie, my favourite one is Girl, Interrupted by James Mangold by the way, and 
                        listening to music, I particularly enjoy Phonk at that moment.

                    <p class="animate-text">I am registered at the IUT of Dijon in a Computer Science BUT. Before that, I had in 
                        mind to become a doctor so I started my student life by doing a First Common Year for Health Studies. It was 
                        not what I expected so I studied psychology hoping I could understand how the human brain works. It was really 
                        interesting but I couldn't see myself working in this field. So, passionate about artificial intelligence, 
                        I decided to do a computer science BUT in order to have the chance to work on AI technologies assisting medicine.
