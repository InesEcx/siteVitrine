                    <h2 class="animate-text">Traveling and photography</h2>
                    <p class="animate-text">I enjoy traveling as much as drawing. I aspire to win enough money 
                        to travel all around the world. It will even be better if my future job allows me to move around 
                        for work. What I appreciate the most when I travel is to discover new tradition, new way of living and 
                        new landscapes. Because when I am making a trip I always take my camera with me and wander in the 
                        nature in search of wonders. My camera is a Sony ILCA-68 (α 68). One thing on my to-do list to buy 
                        lenses compatible with my camera.

                    <h2 class="animate-text">My ethnic roots</h2>
                    <p class="animate-text">To know a bit more about me, I am a mixed-race woman. My dad is french and born in France. 
                        My mom was french but originally she was Moroccan because she was born in Morocco. She came in France when she 
                        was a teenager. So, it makes me half french and half moroccan. So, I had the chance to go to Morocco few times, 
                        five times to be more precise. The first time I went was in 2008. It was my first trip ever. Since then, every 
                        year I went on a trip to discover and learn as much as I can.

                    <p class="animate-text"> Before going anywhere outisde of France, I did few years ago - when I was 19, a road trip 
                        all around my native country with friends. We went visiting all the biggest cities and on our way, we were 
                        stopping by smaller ones to maybe have the chance to discover treasures. Furthermore, I went to Italy, two 
                        times. In those two trips, I went visiting Roma, Milano, Turino. I also went to Spain three times (it was to 
                        enjoy the beach more than visiting tho). I also went to Switzerland and Belgium more than once. Finally, my 
                        next trip will be in a Nordic country, either Norway or Sweden. Stay tuned !
