            <h2>Rhiph's story</h2>
            <img src="CSS\Images\Drawing\Rhiph\BD2.png" alt="Page of my manga Rhiph" class="editorial-image-right">
            <p>This story follows the story of three characters, Epsilon, Azalée and Jahan. Before talking about them, let me give you some context about the main story.</p>
            <p>In RHIPH, there are several worlds, the mortal world, this one is connected all worlds existing, indeed, it requires a passage through this dimension in order to reach another. We also have the Limbes, the Purgatory, Heaven and Hell.</p>
            <p>The mortal world is like what we know of Earth however, there are some difference from the original land. First of all, there is only one continent, only one language is spoken, there are a lot of zones really dangerous that aren't approachable because of the parallel worlds. And, there is few population. Also animals doesn't exist anymore.</p>
            <p>The Limbes are a very mysterious world, it is impossible to access it as much as you want. To enter it, you need a person from the Limbes or a portal that opens itself. This world includes all mythological creatures and gods. Those creatures were previously living on Earth with humans but hunted by humans and "killed" at the Last Judgment hence the changes from our Earth.</p>
            <p>The Purgatory regroups all beings possessing supernatural powers such as vampire, witch, mage and werewolf. Unlike the Mortal World, the Purgtory have a fauna and a flora much more developed. Finally, Hell and Heaven are similar to the biblical definition. So, with angels and demons.</p>

            <h2>Who are Rhiph people ?</h2>
            <p>Rhiph people are beings born in those parallel worlds (excepted from the Mortal World, of course). To be a bit more precise, those Rhiphs are originaly humans kids from the Mortal worlds.</p>
            <img src="CSS\Images\Drawing\Rhiph\BD3.png" alt="Page of my manga Rhiph" class="editorial-image-left">
            <p>For approximately 99,80% of those humans baby that becomes Rhiphs are from 0 to 2 years old. 00.18% are kids around 2 to 6 years old. And, 00.02% are 6 years old and more. Adults, if they are not eaten by creatures, cannot stand the atmosphere and then die.</p>
            <p>Children have difficulty getting used to the atmosphere but they can survive in these worlds for several days or even several weeks. Those kids have 38.22% of chance to develop supernatural powers. Babies can get used to it perfectly (except for those who are born with disease, they can have complications). They can survive in these worlds for years or even their whole life ; 99.99% of those baby develop supernatural abilities.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>But now, how those kids end up in these worlds ? Well, basically because of rifts. But not only ! For example, in Heaven or Hell, no rifts open accidentally (at least almost never). They have a good understanding with the human world. If they need soldiers they take unwanted babies. For the purgatory, some breaches can open when the creatures get a little too excited. But most of the time, beliefs make many sects sacrifice their babies to this world. 
               As far for the Limbes, breaches open often, always unexpectedly and for a very short time. Unlike other worlds, humans who fall into this world end up being eaten and it is very rare to come out. Before the arrival of the main heroes, the last being to return from the Limbes was 120 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>Now that they are in these worlds what happened next ? In Hell and Heaven, they are raised as on Earth and sent back when they are powerful enough and trained to carry out missions. Heaven is now mostly populated by Rhiphs. Angels are abstract creatures that are very rare to meet except to make a pact if chosen. On the contrary, Hell is populated only by demons, no Rhiphs end up staying. In the purgatory they are trained the "hard way" and sent back to Earth
               when strong and powerful enough. Often a bit crazy they like to fight but remain the most strategic and never rush in time without thinking. Like animals they rely mostly on their instinct. The Purgatory is mostly populated by all kinds of creatures as well as some Rhiphs who decide to stay and not return to Earth. As far for the Limbes, we don't know much. We only know that this place is a shelter for mythological monsters as long as gods. When babies, children, 
               fall into the Limbes they are automatically eaten, few of them manage to survive and especially to come back to Earth. In this world those who survive learn to fend for themselves, to survive and to try to open a portal to return to Earth. 
            </p>
    
            <h2>Main characters</h2>
            <p>As I already said, they are three main characters, Azalée, Epsilon and Jahan. All three come from the Limbes, obviously. Something important to note is that those who fall in the Limbes age at the speed and time that passes on Earth. So even if it seems for them that only two years pass, it can pass ten years in Earth and therefore take ten years of age at once. Basically they can be two months old the morning and five years old the evening.</p>
            <img src="CSS\Images\Drawing\Rhiph\BD4.png" alt="Page of my manga Rhiph" class="editorial-image-right">
            <p>Who is Azalée ? She is a young girl with strange blue scars, the same color as her eyes, and long black hair with white streaks always tied in a ponytail. She appeared in the Limbes because of a portal that opened in the maternity ward of city A. She managed to survive there in amiraculous way. As I said, time passing differently, it takes them a few hours to reach the age of five years and thus to be able to walk and run.
               She stayed in the Limbes for several years, the equivalent of five years - which seem impossible. Even if five years passed in the Limbes, she actually left Earth for seventeen years. She doesn't remember much. And, to be fair, normally it is possible to create a portal after a few months or a year max but Aza never succeeded. She managed to go back to Earth because she fell on Jahan and Epsi.
            </p>
            <p>Who is Epsilon ? He is a young man with ebony skin, brown eyes and curly red hair, he has strange crosses around his mouth. He appeared in the Limbes when he was 12 years old, a rift opened on his house with all his family and family friends inside. While his family was being eaten in front of him by the Chimera the years flew by like seconds and he reached 20 years old in no time. Filled with rage he tried to attack the Chimera and as it was about to eat him 
               Epsilon was able to hurt it by cutting off its snake tail. Weakened, it asked him to make a pact. It offered him its knowledge, its powers and its protection in exchange for time, blood and lives to recover. Epsilon's mission is now to contain her within him as much as possible, to use her to the fullest and to take his revenge when the pact comes to an end. He stayed the equivalent of four years on earth in the Limbes (although he was gone for eight years) to 
               attack everything he could to destroy as many monsters as possible. He met Jahan who was hunting too at the end of his journey. Epsi then trained to open portals to help Jahan, which took time but not as much as he thought, thanks to the Chimera knowledge. Together they met Aza and returned to Earth. Both of them knew how to read and write beforehand and became teachers for Aza in the Limbes, who behaved almost like an animal.</p>
            <p>Who is Jahan ?</p>
