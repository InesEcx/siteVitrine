            <h2>Rhiph's story</h2>
            <img src="CSS\Images\Drawing\Rhiph\BD2.png" alt="Page of my manga Rhiph" class="editorial-image-right">
            <p>This story follows the story of three characters, Epsilon, Azalée and Jahan. Before talking about them, let me give you some context about the main story.</p>
            <p>In RHIPH, there are several worlds, the mortal world, this one is connected all worlds existing, indeed, it requires a passage through this dimension in order to reach another. We also have the Limbes, the Purgatory, Heaven and Hell.</p>
            <p>The mortal world is like what we know of Earth however, there are some difference from the original land. First of all, there is only one continent, only one language is spoken, there are a lot of zones really dangerous that aren't approachable because of the parallel worlds. And, there is few population. Also animals doesn't exist anymore.</p>
            <p>The Limbes are a very mysterious world, it is impossible to access it as much as you want. To enter it, you need a person from the Limbes or a portal that opens itself. This world includes all mythological creatures and gods. Those creatures were previously living on Earth with humans but hunted by humans and "killed" at the Last Judgment hence the changes from our Earth.</p>
            <p>The Purgatory regroups all beings possessing supernatural powers such as vampire, witch, mage and werewolf. Unlike the Mortal World, the Purgtory have a fauna and a flora much more developed. Finally, Hell and Heaven are similar to the biblical definition. So, with angels and demons.</p>

            <h2>Who are Rhiph people ?</h2>
            <p>Rhiph people are beings born in those parallel worlds (excepted from the Mortal World, of course). To be a bit more precise, those Rhiphs are originaly humans kids from the Mortal worlds.</p>
            <img src="CSS\Images\Drawing\Rhiph\BD3.png" alt="Page of my manga Rhiph" class="editorial-image-left">
            <p>For approximately 99,80% of those humans baby that becomes Rhiphs are from 0 to 2 years old. 00.18% are kids around 2 to 6 years old. And, 00.02% are 6 years old and more. Adults, if they are not eaten by creatures, cannot stand the atmosphere and then die.</p>
            <p>Children have difficulty getting used to the atmosphere but they can survive in these worlds for several days or even several weeks. Those kids have 38.22% of chance to develop supernatural powers. Babies can get used to it perfectly (except for those who are born with disease, they can have complications). They can survive in these worlds for years or even their whole life ; 99.99% of those baby develop supernatural abilities.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>But now, how those kids end up in these worlds ? Well, basically because of rifts. But not only ! For example, in Heaven or Hell, no rifts open accidentally (at least almost never). They have a good understanding with the human world. If they need soldiers they take unwanted babies. For the purgatory, some breaches can open when the creatures get a little too excited. But most of the time, beliefs make many sects sacrifice their babies to this world. </p>
